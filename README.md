#### Notes

- Since the free basic plan of CoinGecko API is used, there is a limit of 50 requests per minute of fetching the realtime data from CoinGecko.
- The `snapshot.js` file is executed to save and export the `top50Token.json` file to record the top 50 cryptocurrencies in JSON format. This JSON file is later utilised as a matching criteria for the search term we input so that only tokens that are ranked in the top 50 will be shown in the website.
- The fetch method will only be triggered when the search terms have more than two letters. This is to restrict the attempts of fetching.
